<h1> Why I Like To Go Swimming in the Summer.</h1>
<p> Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer.
    When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will me dipping
    into my backyard pool. it's not an impressive pool, only three 
    feet deep, but it's not mine. </p> 
    <p> There are three reason I like to swim:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I get a lot of exercise</li>
    <li> I enjoy the freedom</li>
    <li> I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
    </ul>
